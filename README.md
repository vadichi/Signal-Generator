# Signal Generator

> A signal generator based on a Raspberry Pi Pico

The signal generator can generate square, triangular, saw-tooth, and sine waves of a 3.3 V amplitude and a variable frequency. The signal is generated by the microcontroller using PWM and then smoothed out using an RC low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 5 kHz.

| Component | Value  |
| --------- | ------ |
| R1        | 270 Ω  |
| C1        | 0.1 µF |
| RV1       | 10 kΩ  |

## Dependencies

* `make`;

* `cmake`;

* `gcc`, `g++`;

* `arm-none-eabi-gcc-cs` or equivalent for ARM cross-compilation;

* `arm-none-eabi-newlib` or equivalent;

* Raspberry Pi Pico C/C++ SDK;

## Building

Edit `Source/CMakeLists.txt` to include the `pico_sdk_init.cmake` from your Pico C/C++ SDK folder

```cmake
include(~/Path/pico-sdk/pico_sdk_init.cmake)
```

Run the `Source/build.sh` script to build the firmware (and `chmod +x ./Source/build.sh` the first time). You can run a clean build by deleting the `./Source/build` directory first.

```bash
cd ./Source
./build.sh
```

The firmware binary will be in `./Source/build/SignalGenerator.uf2`.
