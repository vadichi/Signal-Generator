# Signal Generator

> A signal generator based on a Raspberry Pi Pico

The signal generator can generate square, triangular, saw-tooth, and sine waves of a 3.3 V amplitude and a variable frequency. The signal is generated by the microcontroller using PWM and then smoothed out using an RC low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 5 kHz.
